== Basic Spring Web Application

This project contains a web service that will accept HTTP GET requests at
`http://localhost:8080/greeting`.

It will respond with a JSON representation of a greeting, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, World!"}
----
====

You can customize the greeting with an optional `name` parameter in the query string, as
the following listing shows:

====
[source,text]
----
http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User
----
====

The `name` parameter value overrides the default value of `World` and is reflected in the
response, as the following listing shows:

====
[source,json]
----
{"id":1,"content":"Hello, User!"}
----
====

=== Building and running

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw spring-boot:run
----

Then access the endpoint

[source,bash]
----
curl http://localhost:8080/greeting?name=User
